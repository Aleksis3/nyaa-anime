# nyaa-anime

## Overview
### Goals
Create a fully responsive SPA preserving user data with the use of backend services.

### Built using:
Javascript, CSS, HTML, React, Router, FIrebase, slick-carousel, Jikan Moe API

### Usage
To view detailed information about the interesting anime title, user can either
- select it from the main page, using one of the displayed sliders each corresponding to specific genre
- use the search functionality, which can then display a list of all matching titles

Users are able to login or register to then add the desired title to their own anime list or edit already given information (concering the number of watched episodes and alike). They are also able to view their entire list. Aside from being able to edit all given info directly from there, they are also able to sort the order of displayed data by using buttons for asc\desc and desired selector.

## How to run

Execute following command in the project directory:
### `npm start`
You can then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
